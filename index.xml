    <title>Outline Bleeding</title>
    <link>https://linework.ameye.dev/concepts/outline-bleeding</link>
    <guid>https://linework.ameye.dev/concepts/outline-bleeding</guid>
    <description>Issue For the Soft Outline and Wide Outline outline effects, the outlines are rendered by having a silhouette that is dilated in screen-space. Because of the screen-space nature of this effect, the outline will not always completely respect the configured Occlusion State.</description>
