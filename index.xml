    <title>Outline Bleeding</title>
    <link>https://linework.ameye.dev/concepts-explained/outline-bleeding</link>
    <guid>https://linework.ameye.dev/concepts-explained/outline-bleeding</guid>

Because of the screen-space nature of this effect, the outline will not always completely respect the configured Occlusion State.</description>

    <guid>https://linework.ameye.dev/concepts-explained/rendering-layer-masks</guid>
    <description>All outline and fill effects make use of the Rendering Layer Mask system in Unity to control which objects should receive an outline. Using this system you gain a lot of flexibility to define which objects receive which outlines.</description>
