## Known Limitations

## Compatibility

See [[Compatibility]] for more information.

## General

> [!question] Outline/fill does not behave as expected
> When combining multiple types of outline effects or fills, it could sometimes be that their stencil masks interact with each other. Enable the *Force Clear Stencil* toggle in the settings to see if this resolves the issue. If you encounter an issue like this, please [[Contact]] me since I treat it as a bug.
