> [!info] Linework for Unity - A Practical Toolkit for Rendering Outlines
> With Linework you can render high-quality outlines in Unity. Multiple techniques can be used, balancing visual quality and performance. Both full-screen outlines (for outlined art-styles) as per-object outlines are supported. You can also combine outlines with fill effects such as patterns and overlays. The toolkit is designed to be feature-rich and straightforward to use.

You can get Linework from the asset store here https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/294140.
