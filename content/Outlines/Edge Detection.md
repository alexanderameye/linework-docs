**Edge Detection** renders outlines by detecting edges and discontinuities within the scene, such as differences in *depth*, *normal vector*, *color*, or *custom input buffers*. This process creates a consistent outline effect that is applied uniformly across the entire scene, making it suitable for both external and internal object boundaries.

> [!success] Advantages
> - **Consistent Outline:** As a screen-space effect, the outline is uniformly applied across the whole scene, ensuring a consistent look.
> - **Inner Lines:** The effect is able to capture both internal lines as lines on the outside of objects.

> [!error] Disadvantages
> - **Object Exclusion:** Itâ€™s challenging to exclude specific objects or customize the outline effect for individual objects.
> - **Performance:** This is a screen-space effect that runs for the whole screen.

## Discontinuity Sources
The **Edge Detection** effect is able to use a combination of discontinuity sources to determine where a line should be drawn.

Given a scene, a combination of the following discontinuity sources may be used.

**Depth**
The depth of each fragment in the scene. Works well to get the *silhouettes* of objects.
![[Edge Detection-20240823174227596.webp|300]]

**Normals**
The orientation of each fragment in the scene. Works well to get fine details in objects if they have a *different orientation*.
![[Edge Detection-20240823174300658.webp|300]]

**Luminance**
The luminance of each fragment in the scene. Works well to pick up on *differences in color/brightness* between surfaces, even if they have the same orientation. 
![[Edge Detection-20240823174325562.webp|300]]

**Combined**
By combining *depth*, *normals* and *luminance*, the outlines come out like this.

## Section Map (Advanced Usage)


> [!important] Advanced Usage
> The *Section Map* is a powerful feature that may be used for rendering outlines. However, be sure that you read the documentation carefully. If things do not work out of the box or you have questions, [[Contact]] me. Thanks!

> [!info] Section Map
> The *Section Map* is a special texture that is generated during the rendering process and used by the edge detection shader to determine where to draw edges. The section map uses ***only the R channel***. Additionaly, there are ***2 special values*** that the section map may have.
> 
> ***0.0 = mask*** -> no lines will be drawn
> ***1.0 = fill*** -> a special *Fill Color* will be drawn
> 
> When using *Vertex Colors* or a *Section Texture* as explained below, be sure to note that values of 0 will be used as a mask, and values of 1 will be used as a fill.

The *Section Map* allows us to introduce additional information for the edge detection shader to use, ***without*** adding additional geometry. Some examples:

#### Object ID
Each object is rendered to the *Section Map* using an unique ID. Works well to render outlines between objects. No manual control is possible, everything is generated based on world position.
![[Edge Detection-20240823114241238.webp|300]] ![[Edge Detection-20240823121508202.webp|300]]

#### Vertex Colors
The vertex colors of an object may be rendered to the section map. This gives nearly complete control over outlines. The only limitation is that the necessary geometry needs to be present in order to paint it. This method is able to generate very clean outlines. ***As explained above, be sure to note that values of 0 will be used as a mask, and values of 1 will be used as a fill.***
![[Edge Detection-20240823173833692.webp|300]]![[Edge Detection-20240823173742318.webp|300]]


#### Section Texture
In this mode, a dedicated *Section Texture* is sampled and used to render to the section map. This gives very fine control over outlines. Again, keep in mind that a value of ***0.0 = mask*** and ***1.0 = fill***.

In the settings of the *Section Map* you can choose
- The *Section Texture* that will be sampled. 
- The *UV Set* that will be used to sample the texture. This allows you to have a different UV set specifically for your section texture.
- The *Channel* that will be sampled.

![[Edge Detection-1.png|600]]

Within the package, there is a *section_texture.png* which is recommended for you to use. It contains a 4x4 palette in tints of red. The bottom left value is ***0.0 = mask*** and the top left is ***1.0 = fill***.

![[Edge Detection-2.png|300]]

In your 3D modelling program, you can set up a secondary UV map.

![[Edge Detection-4.png|450]]

You can then UV map your mesh so that surfaces that should have an edge between, have a different color in the palette.
![[Edge Detection-5.png]]

Then in Unity you can choose which UV set to use.

***As explained above, be sure to note that values of 0 will be used as a mask, and values of 1 will be used as a fill.***

![[Edge Detection-20240823203326232.webp|300]]![[Edge Detection-20240823203326397.webp|300]]

The *Section Texture* method involves a bit more work than the *Vertex Colors* method.

#### Keyword
The *Keyword* method is yet another technique to render to the section map. Before rendering to the section map, the ***_SECTION_PASS*** keyword is enabled. After, the keyword is disabled again. This makes it possible to add a ***_SECTION_PASS*** switch at the end of your shaders so you can output whatever you want to the section map.

In the example below I output a pattern of stripes.

![[Edge Detection-8.png|600]]

This gives us the following section map and result.![[Edge Detection-20240824104400047.webp|300]]![[Edge Detection-20240824104332304.webp|300]]


***As explained above, be sure to note that values of 0 will be used as a mask, and values of 1 will be used as a fill.***

The *Keyword* method leaves everything to you. You can output anything you want, irregardless of the geometry of your mesh. 

#### What option to choose?
Let's summarize all the options of outputting to the section map.

***Vertex Color:*** Easiest to use. You could make/use tools that randomly assign a color to a face.

> [!tip] Vertex Color Tooling
> You could use something like IDMapper (I have not tested this personally!) to make it easier to assign vertex colors quickly
> 
> [IDMapper - Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/idmapper)

***Section Texture:*** More setup involved since you need to make a secondary UV map. This also requires you to come up without some kind of method/system so that faces next to each other, don't use the same color. 

***Keyword:*** Use this if you have very specific needs of certain patterns that should be shown, independent of the geometry of your mesh.

## Anti-aliasing
TODO:  check "MSAA will not apply to the edges, since the depth texture is remains aliased. Post processing AA methods do have an effect."
TODO: check "An edge has a minimum thickness of 1 pixel. This means at lower resolutions, edges will appear thicker. For instance, in the scene-view window"
