ðŸ’¡ Render the mesh a second time, with the faces inverted and scaled up.

</aside>

âœ…Â performant

âœ… easily include/exclude objects

âœ… easily set outline overrides

ðŸš« no good inner-outlines, online lines outside of the object

ðŸš«Â artifacts (inconsistent line widths, gaps for hard edges, lines appearing in the interior of the object)

**Additional information**

- Smoothing the normal vectors of the mesh and baking them as vertex colors can fix some artifacts
- Can use a stencil mask to mask out lines within the object
